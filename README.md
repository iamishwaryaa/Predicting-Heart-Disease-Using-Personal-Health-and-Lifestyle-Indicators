Cardiovascular disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality globally. Early identification of individuals at risk of developing heart disease can significantly improve health outcomes through timely interventions and preventive care. 

The primary objective of this study is to explore whether an individual’s personal health and lifestyle characteristics can be used to predict their likelihood of developing heart disease.

The research question guiding this project is:
Can we accurately predict whether an individual is at risk of developing heart disease based on their personal health and lifestyle indicators?

The goal is to develop a predictive model that identifies individuals at high risk of heart disease, allowing healthcare systems to focus on prevention and awareness efforts.
